# CustomSoundBar

This project modifies glappatoni's [soundbar](https://github.com/glappatoni/soundbar) to run in the background as an OSx Agent Application and adds a global keyboard shortcut `⌃ + ⌥ + S` to access the sound bar from anywhere.

CustomSoundBar lets you to play custom sounds from the MacBook touch bar.

## Sound Files

Sound files are loaded from your  `/Home/Music/soundbar`  folder. The touch bar displays a button for each sound file with a label corresponding to the file's name.
