# CustomSoundBar

This project changes glappatoni's [soundbar](https://github.com/glappatoni/soundbar) to run in the background as an OSx Agent Application and and adds a global keyboard shortcut `ctrl + alt + S` to access the sound board from anywhere.

## Sound Files

Sound files are loaded from your  `/Home/Music/soundbar`  folder. The touch bar displays a button for each sound file with a label corresponding to the file's name.
